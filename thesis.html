  <!-- Abstract -->
  <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    Poisson processes provide a simple and powerful model for random events that occur in time. 
    They are used to describe arrivals of packets on a network link, calls in a call center, 
    customers in a queue, or even certain models of cyber attacks. In this short thesis I 
    introduce counting processes, define the homogeneous Poisson process, explain the role of 
    the rate parameter λ, and discuss the link with the exponential distribution of interarrival 
    times. I also show how a Poisson process can be obtained as the limit of a Bernoulli process, 
    and I present a basic simulation experiment that illustrates the main properties.
  </p>

  <div class="page-tag">Page 2</div>

  <!-- Introduction -->
  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    One of the central questions in probability theory is how to model the occurrence of events 
    in time. Sometimes we want to predict the number of login attempts per minute, the number 
    of packets that arrive on a server during a fixed interval, or the number of alarms raised 
    by a monitoring system. In many simple cases we only need a model that captures the average 
    rate of events and some basic randomness around that rate.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Poisson process is one of the most classical models for this purpose. It is simple 
    enough to be taught in an introductory course, yet rich enough to provide intuition for 
    more advanced stochastic processes. This project collects the main ideas regarding Poisson 
    processes, with an eye on clarity and concrete examples, rather than on formal measure 
    theoretic definitions.
  </p>
  <p>
    I start with the general concept of a counting process, then move to the specific defining 
    properties of the Poisson process. After that, I describe the connection with exponential 
    interarrival times and with the Bernoulli process on a fine time grid. I also show a simple 
    simulation scheme that can be implemented in any programming language and discuss how the 
    parameter λ should be interpreted in practice.
  </p>

  <div class="page-tag">Page 3</div>

  <!-- Counting Processes -->
  <h2 id="counting">Counting Processes</h2>
  <p>
    Informally, a counting process is a stochastic process that counts how many events have 
    occurred up to a given time. We denote it by:
  </p>
  <p class="math">
    N(t),  t ≥ 0
  </p>
  <p>
    where N(t) takes integer values. The interpretation is straightforward. For example N(5) 
    could be the number of packets received in the first five seconds, or the number of 
    connection attempts recorded by a firewall in the first five minutes.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are some natural properties that we usually require from a counting process:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>N(t) ≥ 0 and N(0) = 0.</li>
    <li>N(t) takes integer values.</li>
    <li>For s ≤ t we have N(s) ≤ N(t), so the process is non decreasing.</li>
    <li>Events arrive one by one, so the process increases by jumps of size one.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These conditions describe many realistic systems. However, they do not yet specify a unique 
    probability model. The Poisson process adds extra assumptions on how the increments behave.
  </p>

  <div class="page-tag">Page 4</div>

  <!-- Poisson Process -->
  <h2 id="poisson">Poisson Processes</h2>
  <p>
    A homogeneous Poisson process with rate λ greater than zero is a counting process N(t) that 
    satisfies three key properties:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Independent increments.</b> The numbers of events on disjoint time intervals are independent.</li>
    <li><b>Stationary increments.</b> The distribution of N(t + s) − N(s) depends only on t, not on s.</li>
    <li><b>Poisson distribution of increments.</b> For each t the random variable N(t) follows a Poisson law with parameter λt.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The last point can be written as:
  </p>
  <p class="math">
    P(N(t) = k) = e^{−λt} (λt)^{k} / k!,  for k = 0, 1, 2, ...
  </p>
  <p>
    Here λ is the average rate of events per unit time. For example, if λ = 5 per minute, then 
    in a time interval of length two minutes the expected number of events is λt = 10.
  </p>

  <p>
    The figure above shows a schematic sample path of a Poisson process. The horizontal axis is 
    time, and the vertical axis shows the value of N(t). The process stays flat between events 
    and jumps by one each time an event occurs.
  </p>

  <div class="page-tag">Page 5</div>

  <!-- Interarrival times -->
  <h2 id="interarrival">Interarrival Times and Exponential Law</h2>
  <p>
    Another way to describe a Poisson process is through its interarrival times. Let T₁ be the 
    waiting time for the first event, T₂ the time between the first and second event, and so on. 
    For a homogeneous Poisson process with rate λ one can show that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>T₁, T₂, ... are independent.</li>
    <li>Each Tᵢ has an exponential distribution with parameter λ.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The exponential distribution with parameter λ greater than zero has density:
  </p>
  <p class="math">
    f(t) = λ e^{−λt},  for t ≥ 0
  </p>
  <p>
    and distribution function:
  </p>
  <p class="math">
    F(t) = P(T ≤ t) = 1 − e^{−λt}.
  </p>
  <p>
    The mean of T is 1 / λ. So if λ is large, events arrive quickly on average. If λ is small, 
    the process is sparse and we wait longer. This is one of the standard ways to interpret the 
    rate parameter.
  </p>
  <p>
    An important feature of the exponential distribution is the memoryless property:
  </p>
  <p class="math">
    P(T > s + t  |  T > s) = P(T > t).
  </p>
  <p>
    In words, if we have already waited an amount of time s without seeing any event, the extra 
    waiting time still has the same exponential distribution. For the Poisson process, this 
    property can be seen in the fact that the future evolution after a given time does not 
    depend on the detailed past, only on the current count.
  </p>

  <!-- From Bernoulli trials to Poisson -->
  <h2 id="from-bernoulli">From Bernoulli Trials to Poisson</h2>
  <p>
    There is a classical and instructive way to obtain a Poisson process as a limit of a 
    Bernoulli process on a fine time grid. Consider the interval [0, T] and divide it into n 
    small subintervals of equal length Δt = T / n. On each subinterval we perform a Bernoulli 
    trial with success probability:
  </p>
  <p class="math">
    pₙ = λ Δt = λ T / n.
  </p>
  <p>
    A success represents the occurrence of an event in that small interval. If we denote by 
    Xᵢ the Bernoulli variable on subinterval i, then the total number of events in [0, T] is:
  </p>
  <p class="math">
    Sₙ = X₁ + X₂ + ... + Xₙ.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sₙ has a binomial distribution with parameters n and pₙ. A well known limit theorem states 
    that when n grows, pₙ shrinks, and n pₙ tends to λT, the binomial distribution converges 
    to the Poisson distribution with parameter λT. In our setting n pₙ equals λT exactly, so:
  </p>
  <p class="math">
    Sₙ  →  Poisson(λT)
  </p>
  <p>
    as n tends to infinity. This construction shows why the Poisson process is often described 
    as the limit of a discrete time Bernoulli process, under a regime where events are rare in 
    each small interval but the total expected number in a fixed time window remains finite.
  </p>

  <div class="diagram">
Discrete time grid with Bernoulli trials:

Interval [0, T] split into n pieces, length Δt = T/n

Trial outcomes:  0  1  0  0  1  0  0  1  ...
                 ↑     ↑        ↑
               events at these grid cells

As n grows and Δt shrinks, the event times approach a Poisson process.
  </div>

  <div class="page-tag">Page 7</div>

  <!-- Simulation study -->
  <h2 id="simulation">Simulation Study</h2>
  <p>
    There are two common ways to simulate a homogeneous Poisson process on the interval 
    [0, T]. One method uses exponential interarrival times. The other uses a fine time grid 
    and Bernoulli trials.
  </p>

  <h3>Simulation via exponential interarrival times</h3>
  <p>
    In this method we start at time zero and repeatedly draw independent exponential 
    variables with parameter λ. Each value is interpreted as the waiting time until the next 
    event. We stop when we exceed T.
  </p>

  <div class="diagram">
Algorithm (exponential interarrival times):

time = 0
N = 0
while time < T:
    draw U uniform in (0,1)
    set W = -(1/λ) * log(U)
    time = time + W
    if time ≤ T:
        N = N + 1
        record an event at this time
  </div>

  <p>
    The sequence of recorded times gives us one sample path of the Poisson process. Repeating 
    the experiment several times allows us to study the distribution of N(T) and to estimate 
    how often we see each value k.
  </p>

  <h3>Simulation via Bernoulli approximation</h3>
  <p>
    Alternatively, we fix a large n and use the discrete time approximation described in the 
    previous section. On each grid cell we simulate a Bernoulli variable with success 
    probability λΔt, where Δt equals T divided by n. The total number of successes is compared 
    with the Poisson law with parameter λT. For large n the two distributions match very 
    closely.
  </p>

  <div class="page-tag">Page 8</div>

  <!-- Applications -->
  <h2 id="applications">Applications and Interpretation of λ</h2>
  <p>
    The rate parameter λ determines the typical speed of the process. Its interpretation is 
    almost always:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Expected number of events per unit time.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For example, if λ equals three per hour, then on average we observe three events in each 
    hour, six events in a two hour window, and so on. More formally:
  </p>
  <p class="math">
    E[N(t)] = λ t.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a network setting N(t) could count the number of packets arriving on a link or the 
    number of connection requests observed by a server. In a cybersecurity context λ might be 
    estimated from historical data and used as a baseline. Large deviations of N(t) from its 
    expected value could indicate an attack or some unusual activity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, real data are often more complicated than the ideal Poisson model. Rates can 
    change over time, events can be correlated, and the arrival process can have bursts. Even 
    in those cases, the Poisson process remains a useful starting point. It provides a simple 
    reference model against which more complex behavior can be compared.
  </p>

  <div class="diagram">
Examples of λ:

λ = 0.5 per minute   → rare events
λ = 5   per minute   → frequent arrivals
λ = 100 per minute   → very dense traffic

E[N(10 min)] = λ * 10

  <!-- Conclusion -->
  <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    In this thesis I have reviewed the basic concepts behind Poisson processes and counting 
    processes. I started with the definition of a counting process, then introduced the 
    homogeneous Poisson process through its increment properties and Poisson distribution. 
    I discussed the exponential distribution of interarrival times and the memoryless 
    property, which are key features of this model.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also explained how a Poisson process can be obtained as a limit of a Bernoulli process 
    on a fine time grid, under a regime of rare events with a fixed average rate. A simple 
    simulation study showed how to implement the model using exponential waiting times or 
    discrete Bernoulli approximations. Finally, I highlighted some practical interpretations 
    of the rate parameter λ, especially in settings where arrivals correspond to events in 
    networks or simple models of attack processes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although real systems often deviate from the ideal assumptions of the Poisson model, 
    understanding this process is an important step towards more advanced stochastic models. 
    It provides a first approximation that is mathematically tractable, easy to simulate, 
    and conceptually clear.
