    <p>In today’s digital world, information moves through networks every second. It shapes how we communicate, work, and protect ourselves online. In this constant flow of data, cybersecurity depends on a powerful ally: statistics. It gives meaning to numbers and helps experts see patterns hidden beneath the surface. Through it, dangers can be recognized before they appear.</p>

    <p>Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data. In cybersecurity, it helps experts observe the activity of digital systems and notice what is normal and what is not. By studying network traffic or user behavior, statistics can reveal unusual movements or small deviations that may signal a threat. What seems random can become a clue in the hands of someone who knows where to look.</p>

    <p>Its value goes further. Statistics allows analysts to study past incidents and estimate where vulnerabilities may exist. It supports models that learn from experience, creating the mathematical base for machine learning. These tools help computers recognize attacks faster and respond more accurately. Even simple calculations, such as averages or deviations, guide security teams toward better decisions.</p>

    <p>In the end, statistics turns cybersecurity into a smarter and more deliberate process. It replaces uncertainty with knowledge and gives defenders of the digital world the insight they need to stay one step ahead of those who seek to cause harm.</p>
