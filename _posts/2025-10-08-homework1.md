## Introduction
In today’s digital world, vast amounts of information move through networks every second. This flow shapes how we communicate, work, and protect ourselves online. Within this constant motion, cybersecurity depends on a powerful ally, statistics. It gives meaning to numbers and helps experts see patterns beneath the surface. Through it, dangers can be recognized before they appear.

## What statistics is
Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data to draw reliable conclusions. In cybersecurity it becomes a way to observe the life of digital systems. It helps us notice what is normal and what is not. By studying network traffic and user activity, analysis can reveal unusual movements or small deviations that may signal a threat. What seems random becomes a useful clue.

## How it supports cybersecurity
Its value goes further. Statistics allows analysts to study past incidents and estimate where vulnerabilities may exist. It supports models that learn from experience. This creates the mathematical base for machine learning, which helps computers recognize attacks faster and respond with more accuracy. Even simple measures, such as averages and deviations, guide security teams toward better decisions and clearer priorities.

## Conclusion
In the end, statistics turns cybersecurity into a smarter and more deliberate process. It replaces uncertainty with knowledge and gives defenders of the digital world the insight they need to stay one step ahead of those who seek to cause harm.
